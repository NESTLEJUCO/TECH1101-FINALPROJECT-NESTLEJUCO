          Our experience with Green Thumb Landscaping was awesome! They repaired
          our landscaping in St. Albert. Christopher Watson, in particular, was
          professional, polite and hardworking. He wanted to make sure we were
          happy with the job every step of the way! Thank you Green Thumb
          Landscaping for a job well done! Great job Christopher!

          I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks Landscaping
          Limited for the incredible work they did for my yard in the Newcastle
          area. Not only did the crew work diligently to complete my yard in a
          timely fashion, they were very nice and polite and went out of their
          way to ensure everything that I asked for was done. They were
          extremely patient with the issues raised regarding some of the
          neighbours concerns. They were also always asking me if there was
          anything more they could do which made me feel that they genuinely
          wanted to do their best work. The landscaping crew as a whole was
          beyond fantastic and extremely polite and professional. In particular,
          I want to thank Matt & Jimmy (who worked on the fence and deck) for
          being outstanding employees. They not only fixed and addressed all of
          my concerns but they went out of their way to make sure everything was
          completed at a high standard. For example, I had mentioned a concern
          about the grass (even though they were not the ones who put it in) and
          the next day they brought new sod in and replaced the bad parts. I
          would also like to extend my gratitude to Chad, as he too went above
          and beyond to organize everything I asked for. From putting up with
          all of my phone calls, to following up with all my changes; he made
          sure our new yard and deck was taken care of. I wanted to write this
          letter expressing how much I appreciate all of the crewâ€™s hard work,
          and how impressed I am with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.

          Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping happen. I
          had no clue of how to set up my yard, but they came and gave me an
          awesome plan and executed. The city had put requirements on my
          property that needed to be met. I was unsure on how to meet the
          requirements and stay within my budget. After a brief meeting with a
          park representative they had created a plan that to fulfill the
          requirements and had booked a time to finish the job. A great thing
          when you are spending so much money is to see the crew actually
          working swiftly and not taking long breaks. Parkâ€™s guys worked
          straight until dark each day to finish the job. I would totally
          recommend Green Thumb Landscaping to anyone. In fact, I did recommend
          them to a neighbour down the street. He went with Park because they
          were able to deliver a prompt and professional service. Thank you
          Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done!

          We were very impressed. Weâ€™ve done a lot of work to our home and
          property and this has been by far one of the best experiences! They
          met or exceeded expectations every step of the way. The planning
          process was fun, the job started the day weâ€™d planned for and the crew
          was fantastic, working full days until they were done, and touching
          base with me whenever there were decisions to be made (no matter how
          minor). We had a patio area put in for our fire pit, added walkways,
          pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding area and they levelled the
          lawn and put down new sod. The work was top notch. Even more telling
          of the high level of professionalism is the care they put into follow
          up. Theyâ€™ve contacted us, come out to the house to take a look after
          the fact and actually asked for feedback to help them do better in the
          future. I wish all companies cared about their craft as much as the
          team at Green Thumb Landscaping Ltd. When weâ€™re ready to tackle the
          front yard we will definitely be working with them again and we would
          highly recommend them to others ðŸ™‚

          I was very happy with the professionalism and work completed by the
          entire team from the moment we met Mike, to the fantastic office staff
          and the team who completed the job on site. It was a pleasure working

          I have used landscapers before and they are a very professional group.
          They showed up on time, did fast work and cleaned up after every day.
          They took the time to ask me questions while ensuring what I wanted
          was completed. Great job and I would recommend this company.

          We are truly very pleased with the work your team has done on our
          project. Not only were the guys and gals all very pleasant and
          accommodating, they always cleaned up after themselves. Anyone who has
          hired contractors to do work knows how uncommon this trait is.
